- 👋 Hi, I’m @SiHy
- 👀 I’m interested in small independent game development and app creation. Also acting, writing, film-making, video editing, photography and electronics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Godot & GDScript. Also currently learning my way around Linux so I can finally banish Windows.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various things eventually when I feel like a real developer. But not right now.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Don't unless you know me. If you know me, you know where I am.
